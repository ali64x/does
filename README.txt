does : Devide On Equal Sign tool

This tool prepares the input file of urls for the findxss tool ,
it picks all the urls that contains parameters from a list of subdomains,
then devides each url into multiple urls based on how many parameters it contains,
and then it replaces the value of these parameters by "ok",
then removes the duplicates ,
and finally writes out all the valid urls to the desired file so they are ready to be tested by the findxss tool .
